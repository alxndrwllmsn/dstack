# Analysis tools
----

This folder contains various codes built on top of __*dstack*__ to analysise the output of the pipelines. These scripts are not integral part of the package, but can be a valuable addition for creating quick analyitics plots or for validition of the pipeline results.

Using these scripts jointly with __*radiopadre*__ notebooks, the pipelines can appended with validation images that are collected and displayed in a radiopadre notebook for quick validation for the pipeline output.
