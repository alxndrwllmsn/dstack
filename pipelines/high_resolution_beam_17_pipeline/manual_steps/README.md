# Manual steps
----

Similarly to the 2km baseline imaging manual steps are needed. However no 'baseline' imaging need to be done. That is only, the following steps has to be executed:

1. Convert to fits
2. PB correction
3. Source finding via SoFiA

The details are described in the 2km baseline imaging library.

NOTE that the SoFiA poarset file is slightly modified to reflect the slihtly higher oversampling of the synthesised beam (in pixels). That is, only the pixel-based parameters are adjusted.
