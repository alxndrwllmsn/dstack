# dstack pipelines
----

This folder contains stacking pipelines for DINGO using __[Snakemake](https://github.com/snakemake/snakemake)__ to chain _Yandasoft_ with __dstack__ aplications. Each subfolder has a specific pipeline, as modularisation of Snakemake pipelines is not required yet. The pipeline is defined by the respectibe ``Snakefile`` in eah subfolder.

Currently pipelines are running on a local HPC cluster.
